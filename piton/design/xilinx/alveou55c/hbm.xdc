# HBM Catastrophic Over temperature Output signal to Satellite Controller
#    HBM_CATTRIP Active high indicator to Satellite controller to indicate the HBM has exceeded its maximum allowable temperature.
#                This signal is not a dedicated Ultrascale+ Device output and is a derived signal in RTL. Making the signal Active will shut
#                the Ultrascale+ Device power rails off.
#
# From UG1314 (Alveo U280 Data Center Accelerator Card User Guide):
# WARNING! When creating a design for this card, it is necessary to drive the CATTRIP pin.
# This pin is monitored by the card's satellite controller (SC) and represents the HBM_CATRIP (HBM
# catastrophic temperature failure). When instantiating the HBM IP in your design, the two HBM IP signals,
# DRAM_0_STAT_CATTRIP and DRAM_1_STAT_CATTRIP, must be ORed together and connected to this pin for
# proper card operation. If the pin is undefined it will be pulled High by the card causing the SC to infer a CATRIP
# failure and shut power down to the card.
# If you do not use the HBM IP in your design, you must drive the pin Low to avoid the SC shutting down the card.
# If the pin is undefined and the QSPI is programmed with the MCS file, there is a potential chance that the card
# will continuously power down and reset after the bitstream is loaded. This can result in the card being unusable.
